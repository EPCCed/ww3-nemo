# Test for Wave Watch III / NEMO coupling

## Compilation

There are four scripts at the top level: one for each of oasis3-mct, XIOS,
NEMO and WaveWatch III.

They need to be built in that order.

At the moment, oasis3-mct and XIOS will compile in a number of different
compiler configurations. However, for NEMO only `arch2-gnu-r8-d8` works
at the moment. As that is the case, WaveWatch III has only been attempted
for that choice.

See the various build scripts for details.
